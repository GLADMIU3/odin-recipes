        <h3>What are Jamaican Beef Patties</h3>

        <p>Jamaican meat patties are distinctive from others, like 
        this African meat pie, because they boast a yellowish 
        color from tasty turmeric and creamy butter. The beef 
        filling is heavily spiced with cumin, garlic, onions, 
        hot pepper, allspice, thyme, paprika, and curry, 
        differentiating itself from the rest.</p>
        <p>The beef filling is Immaculately spiced. If you can 
         tolerate the heat, then by all means, add some to the 
         filling. I added ½ a teaspoon of chili pepper to make 
         it spicy but not overly hot.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Ingredients:</h3>

        <h4>Pie Crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <h4>Pie Crust</h4>
            <li>Flour – All-purpose flour is the key element for the crust.</li>
            <li>Flavoring – Salt, sugar, and turmeric (with its almost gingery taste)
                 enhance the flavor and give your patties a gorgeous yellow color.</li>
            <li>Fat – Super cold shortening and butter (frozen is even better) 
                creates a melt-in-your-mouth texture.</li>  
            <li>Liquids – Ice-cold water and vinegar keeps the dough tender 
                for an airy texture, moist crumb, and incredible flavor. </li>   
        </ul>

         
        <ul>
            <h4>Beef Filling</h4>
            <li>Ground Beef – The star ingredient for the meat pie filling. 
                But you can use ground pork or chicken for a switch out.</li>
            <li>Seasoning – Curry, onion, garlic, paprika, allspice, dried 
                thyme, white pepper, chili powder, parsley, and green onion 
                spice the meat up. Scotch bonnet pepper is optional for that 
                beautiful heat.</li>
            <li>Chicken Bouillon Powder – For additional meat essence 
                and rich umami flavor.</li>
            <li>Bread Crumbs – This ingredient acts as a binder and keeps 
                the meat from packing together in a hard lump. Yes, you 
                can use gluten-free bread crumbs if you prefer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Make Jamaican Beef Patties</h3>
        <ol>
            <h4>Make the Crust</h4>
            <li>Combine – Mix flour, salt, sugar, and turmeric in a food 
                processor or by hand, and blend well. Add the butter, and 
                shortening, followed by vinegar and water in small amounts, 
                pulse until combined, and the dough holds together in a ball 
                <em>(Photos 1-4)</em>.</li>

            <li>Roll – Place the dough on a well-floured surface. Divide it 
                evenly into two parts and roll them out <em>(Photos 5-6)</em>.</li>
            <li>Shape – Using a large-mouth glass or bowl, about 4-5″, cut out 
                circles by gently pressing the dough and releasing it, shaping 
                the meat patty dough. Continue cutting out circles until they’ve 
                all been cut <em>(Photos 7-8)</em>.</li>
            <li>Chill – Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until ready to 
                use.</li>
