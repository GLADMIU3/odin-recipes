    <h3>What is a Dark ’n Stormy</h3>
    <p>The Dark ’n Stormy is a delicious, easy-to-make cocktail that 
        features a refreshing trio of dark rum, ginger beer and lime. 
        It also goes down a lot easier than the moody name might imply. 
        It’s a close cousin to the Moscow Mule (vodka, ginger beer, 
        lime) and should be an easy transition for vodka drinkers 
        wanting to try something new, but also familiar.</p>
    <p>The popular cocktail can be found all over the world. 
        Its origin, like that of many drinks, is a bit hazy, though 
        it’s likely that rum and ginger beer were first combined by 
        sailors who enjoyed the obvious benefits of rum and the 
        stomach-settling qualities of ginger. But Dark ’n Stormy’s 
        direct lineage can be traced squarely to one island in the 
        Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda.</p>
    <p>Goslings Black Seal is a rich, flavorful rum from Bermuda, 
        where the rum’s long history dates to 1806. Goslings Black 
        Seal features notes of caramel, vanilla and spice, and 
        technically, this rum is the only rum that can be used in 
        a Dark ’n Stormy. The brand Goslings lays claim to the drink; 
        in 1991, it successfully registered a trademark dictating that any 
        drink titled Dark ’n Stormy must be made with only Goslings rum. 
        The company has even sued other beverage brands that have 
        attempted to peddle the drink with their own rums as its star. 
        So, if you really want the full Dark ’n Stormy experience, 
        make it with Goslings.</p>
