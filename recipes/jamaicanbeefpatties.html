        <h3>What are Jamaican Beef Patties</h3>

        <p>Jamaican meat patties are distinctive from others, like 
        this African meat pie, because they boast a yellowish 
        color from tasty turmeric and creamy butter. The beef 
        filling is heavily spiced with cumin, garlic, onions, 
        hot pepper, allspice, thyme, paprika, and curry, 
        differentiating itself from the rest.</p>
        <p>The beef filling is Immaculately spiced. If you can 
         tolerate the heat, then by all means, add some to the 
         filling. I added ½ a teaspoon of chili pepper to make 
         it spicy but not overly hot.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <h4>Pie Crust</h4>
            <li>Flour – All-purpose flour is the key element for the crust.</li>
            <li>Flavoring – Salt, sugar, and turmeric (with its almost gingery taste)
                 enhance the flavor and give your patties a gorgeous yellow color.</li>
            <li>Fat – Super cold shortening and butter (frozen is even better) 
                creates a melt-in-your-mouth texture.</li>  
            <li>Liquids – Ice-cold water and vinegar keeps the dough tender 
                for an airy texture, moist crumb, and incredible flavor. </li>   
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <h4>Beef Filling</h4>
            <li>Ground Beef – The star ingredient for the meat pie filling. 
                But you can use ground pork or chicken for a switch out.</li>
            <li>Seasoning – Curry, onion, garlic, paprika, allspice, dried 
                thyme, white pepper, chili powder, parsley, and green onion 
                spice the meat up. Scotch bonnet pepper is optional for that 
                beautiful heat.</li>
            <li>Chicken Bouillon Powder – For additional meat essence 
                and rich umami flavor.</li>
            <li>Bread Crumbs – This ingredient acts as a binder and keeps 
                the meat from packing together in a hard lump. Yes, you 
                can use gluten-free bread crumbs if you prefer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Make Jamaican Beef Patties</h3>

        <ol>
            <h4>Make the Crust</h4>
            <li>Combine – Mix flour, salt, sugar, and turmeric in a food 
                processor or by hand, and blend well. Add the butter, and 
                shortening, followed by vinegar and water in small amounts, 
                pulse until combined, and the dough holds together in a ball 
                <em>(Photos 1-4)</em>.</li>

                alt="four crust preperation bowl pics" height="390" width="410">
            <li>Roll – Place the dough on a well-floured surface. Divide it 
                evenly into two parts and roll them out <em>(Photos 5-6)</em>.</li>
            <li>Shape – Using a large-mouth glass or bowl, about 4-5″, cut out 
                circles by gently pressing the dough and releasing it, shaping 
                the meat patty dough. Continue cutting out circles until they’ve 
                all been cut <em>(Photos 7-8)</em>.</li>
            <li>Chill – Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until ready to 
                use.</li>

        </ol>

        <ol>
            <h4>Make the Filling</h4>
            <li>Saute – Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a saucepan, followed by 
                onions, garlic, paprika, thyme curry, chili powder, white pepper, 
                allspice, and chicken bouillon. Saute it for about 2 minutes
                <em>(Photos 9-11)</em>.</li>
            <li>Add Meat and Breadcrumbs and continue cooking for 10 or more minutes, 
                frequently stirring, to prevent burning. Then add about 
                ½ cup of water <em>(Photo 12)</em>.</li>

                alt="four mixing filling pics" height="390" width="410">
            <li>Adjust Flavor – Finally, add green onions and parsley and adjust 
                for salt and pepper seasoning <em>(Photos 13-14)</em>.</li>
            <li>Cool – Remove from the heat and let it cool.</li>

        </ol>

        <ol>
            <h4>Assemble</h4>
            <li>Fill – Scoop a heaping tablespoon of filling into each circle, and 
                brush with egg white around half of the circle. Fold over and twist 
                with fingers gently to seal the edges of the meat pie. (Another way 
                of sealing is by pressing the tines of a fork along the edges of 
                the dough) <em>(Photos 15-16)</em>.</li>
            <li>Bake – Carefully arrange the patties on a baking sheet and bake for 
                about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Serve warm, and enjoy!</li>
