            <h3>What is a Caipirinha</h3>

                <p>The classic caipirinha (pronouced kai-pee-reen-ya) is 
                    the mother of all Brazilian cocktails. Made from cachaça, 
                    a Brazilian distilled liquor crafted by the fermentation 
                    of raw sugarcane juice. This refreshing 
                    4-ingredient drink, is the perfect treat for spending a 
                    great summer afternoon with your amigos and familia. 
                    It’s a delicious cocktail that pairs wonderfully 
                    with a churrasco, and all things grilled.

            <h4>Is Cachaça rum?</h4>

                <p>Officially, cachaça is a type of rum. Although they’re 
                both made from sugar cane, the main difference between 
                the two is that cachaça is made from the fermentation 
                of fresh/raw sugarcane juice, while rum is made from 
                sugarcane byproducts like molasses.</p>
